# Training_ResNet50_On_ImageNet
This Python script loads, preprocesses, and shuffles a dataset of cat, dog, horse, and human images for multi-class classification. It handles dataset extraction, image resizing (224x224), label assignment, and data shuffling. The processed data is used for training a ResNet50 model using the ImageNet dataset.
